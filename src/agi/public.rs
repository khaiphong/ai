/*
 Similar to struct InnerSpace of persona.rs, we can custom build these structs of custom LLM.
 In each struct, we use enum for required types and mods for graph directions.
 Reasoning feedback from normative Intelligence is at the core of every specialized AGI 
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyGZPF_RMNE, and reversed engineering from causal Dependent 
 Nature to be statistically tested at the reasoning of custom LLM in specialized fields as a
 Service.
 
 Via Mu front-end container, a Serverless App uses cloudevents and WebSockets to access this
 platform AGI Kp -> ai as the gateway to legally binding of connected services of the persona
 and its binding Activities, Relationships and Places. Each persona has 2 custom LLMs in its 
 registered donain name conncted to unique KpId: Inner and Outer worlds. By default, contracted
 activities of the persona are replicated into the involved party Kp Inner and Outer worlds
