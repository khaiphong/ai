 The result of KP 50+ years of field researches PLUS exoteric / esoteric observations of
 qualified candidates as first front-line soldiers while waiting for verifications and/or
 modifications / enhancements of later academia contributions. We start from actual
 experiences of a Vietnamese student since 1970 all Gotama's recorded Jhanas, further 
 investigated leading to Bodhidharma's exchange with Emperor Wu (Lương Vũ Đế) on “What is the 
 highest meaning of noble Truth" and HuiNeng's specialized contributions about (1) the 
 Three-Not (Wu-Nien, No-Mark, Detachment / Vô Niệm, Vô Vết, Vô Trụ), (2) #DhyanaSamadhi / 
 Thiền Định, (3) #SamadhiPrajna / Định-Tuệ" leading to KP (1) Three-Haves ("#Awareness, 
 Dependent, #Prajna / Kiến Tánh, Duyên Khởi, Bát Nhã"), via (2) observable X-dimension in 
 both exoteric and esoteric realms from Figure 11.1 that forms with personally observable 
 Inner Peace of Y-dimension from Gotama's recorded Jhanas a No-Conflict plan at any focused 
 event and (3) scientifically cultivable #Prajna / Wisdom with discovered underlying natural 
 laws of PrajnaTIPs from one's scienrifically cultivable InnerSpace F-dimension for 
 detoxification of tainted senses. Introducing the #Awareness of a persona F-dimension with 
 Right evolution or Wrong potential degeneration of complex Fibonacci sequence - testable 
 with Vietnamese KienTanh / HuiNeng WuNien / Gotama's Inner Peace / Bodhidharma's 
 #EmptyTheContent - together with Lucas Numbers applicable to innate Intellligence of 
 Illuminati / Communist elites, we theoretically and empirically prove that the Right 
 evolution must come through (type) EquanimityAwareness f+1 = 1 enhanced and materialized in 
 Equanimity Communities where Nature and Science toward What Count join hand. It is then 
 enforced with (type) PurityAwareness f+2 = 1 for the possibility of Transcending the 
 Observed and Observer to see Thing-As-It-Is and #Prajna of breakthrough.

 Pointer is a general concept for a variable that contains an address in memory. Smart 
 pointers are data structures that act like a pointer but also have additional metadata and
 capabilities. Reference smart pointer type enables you to allow data to have multiple owners 
 by keeping track of the number of owners and, when no owners remain, cleaning up the data.
